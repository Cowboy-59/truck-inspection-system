# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive truck inspection system that provides multiple interfaces for conducting and managing truck inspections. The system will include a web application, REST API, and mobile application, all connected to an existing PostgreSQL database. The system will enable inspectors to perform truck inspections, record findings, and manage inspection data across different platforms. The system must support various stakeholders including field inspectors, fleet managers, system administrators, and compliance officers while ensuring data accuracy, regulatory compliance, and seamless user experience across all platforms.
